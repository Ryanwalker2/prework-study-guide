This webpage was created to assist students during the Carlton University Coding Bootcamp. As the semester progresses the webpage will be updated with more notes to help students if they get stuck or can't recall what command to use in a certain situation. By creating this webpage it has helped me enhance my coding knowledge and abilities to hopefully make me a better Web developer in the future.
